# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulation (Python)

A simple **console-based ATM Machine project** built using Python.
This project simulates basic ATM functionalities like checking balance,<br>
depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system,<br>

It is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the use of:

* Functions
* Loops
* Conditional statements
* Variables
* Basic input/output handling

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 Secure PIN verification
* 💰 Check account balance
